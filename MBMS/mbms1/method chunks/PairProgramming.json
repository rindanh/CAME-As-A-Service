   "name": "Pair Programming",
   "description": "Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the strategic direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the tactical aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide. Pair programming increases the man-hours required to deliver code compared to programmers working individually. Experiments yielded diverse results, suggesting increases of between 15% and 100%. However, the resulting code has about 15% fewer defects. Along with code development time, other factors like field support costs and quality assurance also figure in to the return on investment.",
